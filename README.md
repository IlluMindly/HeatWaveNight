Heat Wave Night is a Roblox Adventure game with exploration, quests, and immersive storytelling.

When enough players join the game in the lobby, they are transported to the place in which the game happens.

The player lives in a quite village with a forrest and a nice house. But suddenly, during the night, a heat wave arrives.

The game starts when a player hits over the remote TV inside the house.

To survive the heat wave you need to control the temperature of the player using different tools:

* Inside the house there is a cold generator which controls that the temperature decreases. It works with ice cubes that you need to drop inside it.
* Outside the house the heat wave increases the player temperature

If the temperature of the player is too high or too low, the player dies.

During the night some creatures make things harder:

* Ice Stealers: they steal the ice from the generator stopping it and the temperature in the house increases
* Blaze Claw: a terrible monster coming from the hell that will try to kill you with its claws. It will appear during the night. Inside the house there is a ultra cooler machine that if you drop in it an ice cube and push the Cold button, all the house will be extra refigereted and th blaze claw will be returned to the hell. But it will return!

During te game you can win different badges which will you unique accessories and other extra features that will help you during the game.

Enjoy and good luck!
